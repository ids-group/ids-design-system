# Changelog

All notable changes to `@ids-group-ltd/ids-design-system` are documented here.

Versioning follows [SemVer](https://semver.org). Mapping from commit types:
`fix` → patch, `feat` → minor, breaking change (API or visual) → major.
While the package is on `0.x`, minor releases may contain breaking changes.

## Unreleased

- Added `.t-mono-inline` typography utility — an inline code chip (mono font on a
  subtle surface with padding/radius), completing the mono family alongside
  `.t-mono` (font only) and `.t-mono-block` (block).

## 0.2.1 — 2026-06-16

- Added a `homepage` field linking the live docs/showcase, so the npm package page
  points to it.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-06-16

- **Breaking:** renamed the subtle semantic color tokens `--*-subtle` → `--*-subtitle`
  (border, primary, secondary, tertiary, success, warning, error, info). Consumers
  referencing these tokens must rename.
- Clarified theme re-skin guidance in the shipped `themes/README`: brand roles
  retint automatically from the `--blue` ramp, but a fully calibrated brand may
  set the `--primary-*` roles directly to hand-picked hex.
- Relicensed from proprietary (UNLICENSED) to MIT.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-06-12

Initial public release.

- 45+ standalone Angular components: buttons, forms, overlays, navigation, data display
- Three-tier token architecture: palette → semantic theme → geometry/typography/motion tokens
- Default theme and palette, swappable by consumers
- Bundled Mulish and JetBrains Mono fonts
- SCSS sources shipped in the package (`styles/`, `themes/`)
